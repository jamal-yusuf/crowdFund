One-up site and browse through business ideas, selecting which one they would
like to support. You can also give to the <a href="https://handup.us/members/thesffund"><span style="color:windowtext;
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">One-up</span></a> fund, and we’ll make sure that your euros go towards those with the most urgent needs – i.e. – those that are closest to completion and need a top-up, those that need to get some momentum in their crowdfunding, those in whom a quick start is necessary towards their success etc. Unlike other forms of giving, 100% of your donation goes directly towards business needs, with zero administrative fees. The only fees are the commission charged by the Bank, which again range only between 0.5% to 1.5%. Standard crowdfunding rates range between 4% to 5%. We are proud to have achieved such low rates and thank Alpha Bank and supporting our efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>

will also help entrepreneurs post updates to their donors who helped them

along the way or take advantage of any perks the entrepreneur has offered. </span></p>
